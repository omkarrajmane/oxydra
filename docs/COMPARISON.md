## Comparison: Oxydra vs. ZeroClaw vs. IronClaw vs. MicroClaw

All four are Rust-based AI agent runtimes that emerged from the "\*Claw" ecosystem, although Oxydra strives to be unto its own and not a `*claw`. Each takes a distinct philosophy.

### Security & Sandboxing

| Dimension | **Oxydra** | **ZeroClaw** | **IronClaw** | **MicroClaw** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Isolation tiers** | **3 tiers**: Firecracker micro_vm (strongest) → Docker container → host process | 1: Docker (optional), process-level security | 2: Per-tool WASM + Docker job sandbox | 1: Docker (on/off switch) |
| **Firecracker VM isolation** | **Yes** (Linux; Docker VM on macOS) | No | No | No |
| **WASM sandbox** | **Yes — on ALL tiers** (wasmtime v41 WASI preopens, hardware-enforced capabilities) | Planned, not shipped | Yes — per tool | No |
| **WASM capability profiles** | **5 distinct profiles**: FileReadOnly, FileReadWrite, Web, VaultReadStep, VaultWriteStep | N/A | Yes, capability declarations | N/A |
| **Vault with 2-step semantics** | **Yes** — read and write are separate atomic ops linked by operation_id; vault never simultaneously readable+writable | No | Credential injection at boundary, not 2-step | No |

| **SSRF protection** | **Yes** — IP blocklist + resolve-before-request | Partial (endpoint allowlisting) | Yes (endpoint allowlisting) | No |
| **Per-user workspace isolation** | **Yes** — dedicated guest VM pairs, 4 separate mount points per user | No | No | No |
| **TEE deployment** | Not yet | No | **Yes** (NEAR AI Cloud, verifiable attestation) | No |
| **External dependency for security** | None (embedded) | None | PostgreSQL required | Docker required |

| **Code quality policy** | **Zero clippy warnings** (denied in CI), 100% test coverage for critical paths | Not documented | Not documented | Not documented |
| **Config system** | **6-layer** precedence: built-ins → system → user → workspace → env vars → CLI flags | YAML flat config | TOML + NEAR AI account required | YAML flat config |
| **Type safety** | Typed identifiers (`ModelId`, `ProviderId`), build-time model catalog validation | Not documented | Not documented | Not documented |
| **Tool dispatch strategy** | **Parallel ReadOnly batch** + sequential SideEffecting; order preserved | Sequential | Parallel (priority scheduler) | Sequential |

### Summary: Where Each Wins

| Project | Strongest at |
|---|---|
| **Oxydra** | Defense depth (5 layers, 3 isolation tiers, WASM on all tiers, entropy scrubbing, vault semantics), self learning, architectural rigor (compiler-enforced boundaries, deny.toml, zero clippy), no external DB required, configurable turn budget, context compaction |
| **ZeroClaw** | Ultra-low footprint (~5MB RAM), broadest channel coverage (15+), most LLM providers (22+), fastest startup |
| **IronClaw** | Largest skill ecosystem (~890 curated), TEE deployment, most mature (v0.12.0), NEAR AI cloud integration |
| **MicroClaw** | Simplest multi-channel chat automation, wide agentic iteration budget (100 turns), context compaction |

Oxydra's distinguishing technical advantages are in security architecture and engineering rigour while still maintaining as much, if not more, flexibility as others and keeping self-learning evolution as a key goal: no other project in this group combines Firecracker-level VM isolation + WASM capability profiles on every tier + a vault with 2-step atomic semantics + entropy-based output scrubbing + a compiler-enforced 5-layer defense model — all without requiring an external database or cloud account.
